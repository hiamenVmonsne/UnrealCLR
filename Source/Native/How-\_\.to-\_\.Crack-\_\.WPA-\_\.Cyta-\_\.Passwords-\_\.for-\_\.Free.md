# How to Crack WPA Cyta Passwords for Free
 
WPA Cyta is a wireless encryption protocol that is used by some internet service providers in Cyprus. It is supposed to provide a secure and reliable connection for their customers, but it has a major flaw: it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

A brute-force attack is a method of guessing passwords by trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. This can take a long time, depending on the length and complexity of the password, but it can be sped up by using a wordlist, which is a file containing common or likely passwords.
 
There are many wordlists available online, but some of them are specifically designed for cracking WPA Cyta passwords. These wordlists contain passwords that are derived from the network name (SSID) and the MAC address of the router. By using these wordlists, you can crack WPA Cyta passwords in minutes or even seconds.
 
To crack WPA Cyta passwords for free, you will need the following tools:
 
- A wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection.
- Aircrack-ng, a suite of tools for wireless hacking.
- WpaCytaCracker, a script that automates the cracking process.
- A wordlist for WPA Cyta passwords. You can download one from [here](https://github.com/3xpl01tc0d3r/WpaCytaCracker/blob/master/wordlist.txt).

Once you have these tools, you can follow these steps to crack WPA Cyta passwords:

1. Put your wireless adapter in monitor mode by running this command: `airmon-ng start wlan0`, where wlan0 is the name of your wireless interface. You should see a new interface called wlan0mon.
2. Scan for nearby WPA Cyta networks by running this command: `airodump-ng wlan0mon`. You should see a list of networks with their SSIDs, MAC addresses, channels, and encryption types. Look for networks that have WPA Cyta as their SSID and WPA as their encryption type.
3. Note down the MAC address (BSSID) and the channel (CH) of the network you want to crack. Then stop the scanning by pressing Ctrl+C.
4. Start capturing packets from the target network by running this command: `airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [MAC address] -w [filename] wlan0mon`, where [channel] is the channel of the network, [MAC address] is the MAC address of the network, and [filename] is the name of the file where you want to save the captured packets. You should see a list of clients connected to the network with their MAC addresses and other information.
5. Deauthenticate one of the clients from the network by running this command: `aireplay-ng -0 1 -a [MAC address] -c [client MAC address] wlan0mon`, where [MAC address] is the MAC address of the network and [client MAC address] is the MAC address of one of the clients. This will force the client to reconnect to the network and generate a four-way handshake, which is needed to crack the password.
6. Check if you have captured the handshake by looking at the top right corner of the airodump-ng window. You should see a message saying "WPA handshake: [MAC address]".
7. Stop capturing packets by pressing Ctrl+C.
8. Run WpaCytaCracker by running this command: `./WpaCytaCracker.sh [filename]-01.cap [wordlist]`, where [filename]-01.cap is the file where you saved the captured packets and [wordlist] is the wordlist file you downloaded. The script will extract the SSID and MAC address from the capture file and use them to generate possible passwords. Then it will use aircrack-ng to try each password until it finds the correct one or exhausts the wordlist.
9. If successful, you should see a message saying "KEY FOUND! [password]" with the cracked password. If not, you should see a message saying "Passphrase not in dictionary".
